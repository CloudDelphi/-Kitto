To use the TasKitto database you need to:

1) Setup Firebird 2.5 with a database alias "TasKitto" defined in aliases.conf.
2) Restore DB\TasKitto_Firebird.fbk on a folder of your choosing and have the alias point to the file.
3) Optionally edit database connection parameters in Home\Metadata\Config.yaml and Home\Metadata\ConfigMini.yaml.

To see the application in stand-alone mode, use Config.yaml.

To see the application in a different mode, use ConfigMini.yaml.
