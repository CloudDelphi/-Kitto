To use the TasKitto database you need to:

1) Setup Firebird 2.5 with a database alias "TasKitto" defined in aliases.conf.
2) Restore TasKitto_Firebird.fbk on a folder of your choosing and have the alias point to the file.
3) Optionally edit database connection parameters in Config.yaml and ConfigMini.yaml.
