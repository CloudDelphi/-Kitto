Kitto allows to create **Rich Internet Applications** based on a data model that can be mapped onto any database. The client-side part uses **ExtJS** (through the ExtPascal library) to create a fully **AJAX** application, allowing you to build standard and advanced data-manipulating forms in a fraction of the time.

Kitto is aimed at **Delphi** developers that need to create web application without delving into the intricacies of HTML, CSS, Javascript or learning to use a particular library such as ExtJS, yet it allows access to the bare metal if required.

Kitto includes a **database-agnostic** data-access layer, allowing to create applications that work on any database engine and port applications between database engines.

A Kitto application is described as a set of easily maintained **YAML** files, keeping definitions abstract and declarative and allowing for future extensions. Business rules are enforced either declaratively or through small javascript fragments on the client, or in Delphi code on the server.

Kitto was designed by Nando Dessena and its development is sponsored by [Ethea](http://www.ethea.it/), which uses Kitto for internal development projects and client work and provides Kitto-related tools, support and development services.
